**The Rust Programming Track**

---

## Overview

Welcome to **immarustacean**, my personal Rust learning repository! This repo documents exercises, projects, and experiments as I progress through the Rust programming language.

The focus is on practicing **Rust fundamentals** and building real projects while learning from:

- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) – interactive Rust exercises.
- [Exercism - Rust Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust) – problem-solving exercises to reinforce concepts.

---

## Contents

- `rustlings/` – exercises completed from Rustlings.
- `solutions/` – solutions and notes from Exercism Rust exercises.
- `projects/` – small Rust projects built to reinforce learning.
- `docs/` – notes, explanations, or guides during learning.

---

## Goals

- Master core Rust concepts: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, traits, generics, and error handling.
- Solve Rust problems in a hands-on way via Rustlings and Exercism.
- Build small-to-medium projects to practice real-world Rust usage.
- Track and document learning progress in a structured way.
